# public-speaking-group
Repo for a public speaking group I'm organizing

Present to the group specifically to practice your speaking / presenting skills. Bias towards technical topics but could really be anything. **Primary goal: Make it interesting and engaging for the audience.** Passionate about rock climbing? Present about that. Those skills will carry over very nicely to presenting technical topics.


## Loose structure / principles
* Remote first
* Sessions will be recorded
* Like a writing group
* Starting out it'll be 30min. 2-3 10min slots.

## 2 primary objectives when presenting
1) Teach me something
2) [Make me care](https://nofilmschool.com/2014/08/pixar-andrew-stanton-equation-make-audience-care)

## Loose Code of Conduct
This is a SAFE space for you to practice and experiment and explore speaking & presenting techniques. We will support you and encourage you and give you feedback to improve.
